  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Blaine Aweke.</p>
  <p>Things I like: animals, coffee, the environment, the holiday season, playing the piano, activism, and volunteering</p>
  <p>Things I don't like: when people make me choose between dogs and cats.</p>
  <p>Fun Fact:I run a semi-popular Instagram page focused on social and political issues.</p>
  <p>I like these sites, maybe you will too:</p>

<h2>Creations!</h2>
<p>A couple days ago, I attempted with a partner to create a functioning side scrolling game. The little dog wants to reach the dog house and eat as many treats as possible but he has to get around bricks and mud or else the game restarts.</p>
